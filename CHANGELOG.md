# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **All Pokémon table (new tab):** a sortable, filterable view of every party and PC Pokémon in one table (dex #, level, nature, ability, all six IVs, IV total, BST, location). Click-to-sort columns, name/species/ID search, quick filters (Shiny, Hidden ability, 6 IV, 2+ perfect IVs), and minimum IV thresholds with Match all / Match any (AND/OR) modes plus a minimum IV total. Rows open the existing editor modal. Backed by a new `getAllOwnedPokemon()` aggregator with backend/local parity.
- **Multiselect + bulk actions in the All table:** per-row selection shares the existing roster export queue; Select filtered, COPY SELECTION, and EXPORT act on the current selection.
- **PC release (delete Pokémon):** release a single PC Pokémon from the editor modal, or mass-release selected PC Pokémon from the All table (party Pokémon are skipped). New `POST /pc/release` endpoint and `releasePcMon` local core logic with backend/local parity and checksum-safe writes.
- **Move Pokémon between party and PC** — move a party Pokémon to the first free PC slot, or a PC Pokémon into your party, from the editor modal (local mode only).
- **Living Dex tab** — read seen/caught completion from save bitfields (species IDs 1–999), Unbound Dex location links (`GET /pokedex/summary`; local core parity). Defaults to an in-game-style view that hides species you haven't seen or caught yet; sortable table with Dex #, Pokémon, Type, and Status columns, plus a type filter dropdown. Row links go directly to the species' Unbound Dex page (`?species=SPECIES_X`) via `species_constants.json`, instead of a name-search results page.
- **Living Dex flags in editor** — Seen/Caught controls on the Pokémon editor Dex tab with user confirmation.
- **Dex progress-aware learnsets** — TM/HM bag ownership hints and move deep links on the editor Dex tab (`gameProgress` snapshot + `dexProgress.js`).
- **Roster export (full stack)** — COPY/EXPORT ROSTER and COPY PARTY as Markdown with game progress, level cap checks, expert speed tiers, evolution hints, and calculated battle stats (local + backend parity via `GET /game-progress`).
- **Selective roster export** — session-only export queue (+ toggle on party/PC); COPY/EXPORT SELECTION with detailed PC blocks for agent comparison.
- **Cap profile selector** — Normal / Expert level-cap context for legit warnings and roster export.
- **Stat calc + editor preview** — ROM-truth battle stat preview and Hidden Power type in the editor and roster export.
- **Linked Save Sync** (Phase 1+2) — link a `.sav` on disk via File System Access API for live two-way sync with mGBA. Auto-reload on external changes, conflict banner when PUSE has unsaved edits, silent write-back on save. Behind `VITE_FEATURE_LINKED_SAVE=1` flag; launch with `Open PUSE Linked.bat` or `npm run dev:linked`.

### Changed

- Added caught-ball preservation and editing for Party and PC Pokemon across backend and local frontend runtimes. The editor now shows the ball each Pokemon was caught in, exposes a dedicated caught-ball selector separate from held items, supports all CFRU/Unbound ball types, and writes the compact ball enum safely without confusing it with item IDs. New PC Pokemon insertions now default to Poke Ball unless another caught ball is selected.
- Mirrored caught-ball parsing metadata in Switch and 3DS homebrew core structs so native runtimes preserve and expose the same save byte fields used by backend/local mode.

### Planned

- Save state files editing
- Assign any ability to any Pokémon
- 3DS porting
- Generate .pkm files from existing Unbound mons
- Pokémon trainer editing
- Generate valid mistery gifts
- Add create/insert workflows to add Pokemon to party (with validation and checksum-safe writes).
- Add ROM-truth sprites for Pokémons and items with ROM-based sprites extraction.
- Investigate save flags editing feasibility for difficulty mode and NG+ state.
- Extend Trainer Profile editing to include identity metadata: name (with character encoding validation), gender/style flags, and appearance parameters (hair color/skin tone).
- Implement "Costume Box" unlocker and wardrobe editing.
- Find a way to manually flag "Seen" or "Caught" when editing a species that hasn't be seen/caught before. Leaving the decision to flag it to the user, thus the "manually".
- Complete box 20 fallback mapping for slots `22..30` in the Unbound tail layout. Current support enables slots `1..21` only, because the remaining segment overlaps ambiguous trailer bytes where deterministic slot mapping is not yet proven checksum-safe across save variants.
- Add keyboard-assisted stat editing shortcuts (Ctrl+click to set max, Alt+click to set zero) for IV/EV fields.
- Happiness editing
- ~Investigate ROM-truth naming mismatch reports (for example Rhyperior shown as `Filter` vs expected `Solid Rock`) and align visible labels where appropriate.~ This now has [an opened issue](https://github.com/Zannael/PUSE/issues/7).

## v1.3.0 - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Added Nintendo Switch homebrew port (`switch-homebrew/`) built with Plutonium (SDL2) + libnx: party editing (species, nickname, level, nature, item, ability slot, IVs, EVs, moves + PP/PP-Up, shiny, gender), PC box browsing (18 boxes × 30 slots) with full per-mon field editing, money read/write (u32 + BCD3 up to 999,999,999), home menu navigation, and in-place `.sav` write with X-button save + toast confirmation. Checksum recalculation (GBA section checksum + per-section commit) matches backend behavior exactly.
- Updated shiny recognition + PID shiny-target solving to use Unbound/CFRU 1/4096 parity (`SV < 16`) in backend/local mode, fixing false non-shiny reports for legitimate in-game conversions (for example scammer-method shinies).
- Added backend regression coverage for scammer-method shiny + BP deltas (`backend/tools/shiny_bp_regression.py`) using saved before/after fixtures, including issue `#11` validation on reported party mons.
- Backend money updates now clamp requested values to the extended CFRU legal range (`0..999999999`) and return clamp metadata (`requested_money`, `was_clamped`).
- Added backend Battle Points read/update endpoints (`GET /bp`, `POST /bp/update`) using active section `id=4` offset `0xF34` with clamp metadata.
- Replaced the money-only modal with an `Edit Resources` flow that updates both Money and Battle Points with backend/local parity.
- Resource inputs now enforce whole-number bounds in UI: Money (`0..999999999`) and Battle Points (`0..65535`).
- Fixed sparse Ball pocket resolution in both backend and local mode by preferring validated static anchors for low-slot pockets and skipping footer-adjacent false candidates; this resolves `.srm` reports where Ball edits targeted decoy offsets (for example Ultra/Master/Net/Nest ghost pockets) instead of the real in-game Ball pouch.
- Added a standalone SRM/SAV conversion utility (separate from the main editor, similar to RTC tools) with backend/local mode parity, including `POST /save/convert`, local in-browser conversion logic, and a dedicated pre-upload `SRM / SAV Converter` panel.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04-24

### Added

#### ROM Truth Data

- Added Unbound ROM move extraction tooling (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_moves_table.py`) with diagnostic output (`backend/data/move_table_from_rom.json`).
- Move extraction now infers move count directly from ROM (instead of inheriting a previous `moves.txt` cap), and refreshed catalogs now include the full detected Unbound move table (`922` moves).
- `backend/data/move_table_from_rom.json` now supports merged `base_pp` per move row when PP metadata is provided from ROM-derived extraction.
- Move catalogs are now synchronized from ROM truth with `backend/data/moves.txt` as canonical runtime source (mirrored to `frontend/public/data/moves.txt` for local mode parity).
- Added Unbound ROM ability extraction tooling (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_abilities_table.py`) with diagnostic output (`backend/data/ability_table_from_rom.json`).
- Ability catalogs are now synchronized from ROM truth with `backend/data/abilities.txt` as canonical runtime source (mirrored to `frontend/public/data/abilities.txt` for local mode parity).
- Added Unbound ROM species extraction tooling (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_species_table.py`) with diagnostic output (`backend/data/species_table_from_rom.json`).
- Species catalogs are now synchronized from ROM truth with backend/frontend parity, and species base stats were regenerated from ROM (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_species_base_stats.py`).
- Added Unbound ROM species growth-rate extraction tooling (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_species_growth_rates.py`) and synchronized species growth metadata (`backend/data/species_growth_rates.json` mirrored to `frontend/src/core/speciesGrowthRates.json`) for backend/local parity.
- Added Unbound ROM species abilities metadata extraction tooling (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_species_abilities_meta.py`) with anchor validation (Gliscor -> Poison Heal, Raticate base -> Hustle), and synchronized metadata (`backend/data/species_abilities_meta.json` mirrored to `frontend/src/core/speciesAbilitiesMeta.json`).
- Added ROM-derived species form alias extraction tooling (`backend/tools/extract_unbound_species_form_aliases.py`) with synchronized alias metadata (`backend/data/species_form_aliases.json` mirrored to `frontend/src/core/speciesFormAliases.json`) and diagnostics output (`backend/data/species_form_aliases_diagnostics.json`).

#### Species, Forms, and Nicknames

- Pokemon species editing is now available in the editor for both Party and PC flows, with matching behavior in `backend` and `local` runtime modes.
- Species UI payloads now expose form-aware metadata (`species_label`, `species_variant_index`, `species_variant_count`, `is_form_variant`) so duplicate-name forms are distinguishable (for example `Goodra (Form 1)` / `Goodra (Form 2)`).
- Added nickname editing support for Party and PC flows in both backend and local modes, including save-path parity.
- Species editor now includes nickname controls and a guided rename behavior when changing species, so users can keep custom nicknames or automatically align nicknames with the selected species.
- Species labels now prefer high-confidence ROM-derived aliases (for example Alolan/Galarian/Hisuian/Mega/Giga and special cases like Aegislash Blade / Darmanitan Zen / Polteageist Chipped) with safe fallback to `Form N` labels when aliases are uncertain.

#### Party and PC Correctness

- Party stat bytes are now recalculated after species/stat-affecting edits (species, IVs, EVs, nature, level) using ROM-derived base stats and nature modifiers, with current HP clamped to the new max HP.
- Fixed PC Box move packing/parsing to use the correct CFRU compact 40-bit layout in both backend and local mode.
- Fixed local-mode 32-bit overflow during 40-bit move bit-packing by switching to `BigInt`, resolving slot corruption cases (for example `DragonAscent`/`V-create` turning into wrong moves in frontend or in-game).
- Added fragmented absolute-layout fallback support for PC boxes 22-24 in save variants where the standard contiguous PC stream does not include those boxes, with backend/local parity for read/edit/save/checksum flows.
- Fixed fallback PC box extraction for rotated save-section layouts by resolving box 23/24 offsets from active logical sections (instead of static absolute addresses), with backend/local mode parity and regression verification across local artifact saves.
- Added reverse-engineered fallback mappings for previously locked Unbound tail boxes with backend/local parity: box 20 (slots `1..21`), box 21 (`1..30`), box 22 (`1..30`), box 23 (`1..30`), and box 24 (`1..30`), while keeping box 25 intentionally non-writable/non-navigable.
- Absolute PC fallback writes now track touched sectors for checksum recalculation only when the target sector belongs to an active save index (`save_idx > 0`), avoiding trailer-sector checksum side effects.
- Fixed PC stream payload decoding/writing parity in backend/local mode by restoring the Unbound stream window to `0xFF0` bytes from section offset `+0x04`, preventing cross-box decode drift/regressions on real saves.
- Absolute touched-sector checksum reconciliation now skips opaque section `id=4` in backend/local mode, preserving stable save acceptance for Unbound layouts where that section checksum is not safely recomputed with the generic path.
- Added focused PC stream regression checks (`backend/tools/pc_stream_regression.py`) using issue fixtures to validate Box 3/4 species continuity and guard against payload-window regressions.
- Fallback box validation now evaluates only mapped slots per layout (instead of forcing all 30 slots), improving fragmented-layout safety and reducing false lockouts.
- Added focused regression coverage for fallback PC boxes (`frontend/scripts/pc-fallback-regression.mjs`) to validate FewTimesDead box 22-24 detection, fallback slot parity, absolute fallback edits, touched-sector checksum updates, and Unbound false-positive guards.
- Added `PC insert` workflows (backend + local mode parity) to create Pokemon directly in empty box slots, including stream boxes, preset box 26, and fragmented fallback box layouts.
- Added species drift safety checks for non-species edit flows and tightened save paths to send only changed fields, reducing unintended side effects.
- Party level edits now default to ROM-truth species growth rate when available, with fallback to previous growth inference behavior when metadata is unavailable.
- PC level editing now defaults to ROM-truth species growth rate in the editor flow (manual override still supported), reducing EXP/level ambiguity.
- Party and PC payloads now expose full ROM-derived ability metadata (slot 1/slot 2/hidden IDs and names) with runtime parity.

#### Move PP Integrity and Editing

- Added ROM-truth move PP wiring from `move_table_from_rom.json` (`base_pp` by `move_id`) into backend/local PP calculations.
- Added Party PP fields end-to-end (`move_pp`, `move_pp_ups`, `move_pp_max`) with legality enforcement in save writes.
- Added move-swap PP safety: changing a move now resets current PP to the new legal max, preventing invalid `M/N` states.
- Added PC PP Up support (`move_pp_ups`) and legal max PP derivation in payloads for backend/local parity.
- Extended Party/PC update contracts to accept PP fields and keep backend/local behavior aligned.
- Added editor controls for per-slot PP/PP Up with `MAX PP` action and live `current/max` display in move editing flows.

#### Party and PC Identity with PID Safety

- Implemented identity editing controls in the Pokemon editor for both Party and PC flows (shiny toggle + gender toggle), with PID side-effect warnings in UI.
- Added identity update flows for Party and PC in both runtime modes (`backend` and `local`) to preserve parity.
- Identity PID solving now preserves nature and standard ability-slot parity while applying shiny/gender targets when valid across Party and PC edits.
- Added species identity metadata (`gender_threshold`) extracted from ROM truth and mirrored to frontend local mode.
- Added explicit validation for incompatible gender requests (fixed male/fixed female/genderless species), returning clear errors instead of silent mutation.
- Added PID-focused regression coverage (`frontend/scripts/identity-regression.mjs`) for Party and PC shiny/gender toggles, HA preservation, invalid-gender guards, and mixed PID edit sequences across backend/local parity.

#### Bag UX and Safety

- Bag quick-pocket safety now gates TM Case and Berry Pouch editing by unlock state: non-empty pockets are editable, while empty pockets are editable only when the corresponding key item is present (`TM Case` / `Berry Pouch`).
- Quick-pocket responses now include readiness/lock metadata (`ready`, `locked`, `locked_reason`, `unlock_via`) and can expose safe empty-slot bootstrap candidates only for unlocked TM/Berry flows.
- Main pocket detection now resolves from active section `id=13` first (anchor template) and supports unusually long pocket streams, fixing bootstrap/search failures on long-list saves (for example FewTimesDead variants) with backend/local parity.
- Bag editing now uses an explicit save flow: slot edits are applied in memory, and `SAVE BAG CHANGES` is required to write updates to the `.sav` file.
- Bag UX now keeps save actions visible at the top of pocket view and warns users when navigating back/changing sections with unsaved bag edits.
- Fixed item-sector checksum window for Unbound main items sector (`id=13`) to `0x450` in both backend and local mode, preventing intermittent save corruption caused by extra trailing bytes.
- Backend money updates now clamp requested values to the legal in-game range (`0..999999`) and return clamp metadata (`requested_money`, `was_clamped`) for safer API behavior.

#### Editor UX

- Pokemon editor Info tab now shows Species controls before level/nature/item controls for faster access.
- Ability controls now show resolved ROM-truth ability names for slot buttons and current-ability labels (including hidden ability names when available).
- PC grid empty slots now support in-place add flow via modal (species search + nickname + level) with save-path parity across backend/local modes.
- PC box navigation now reflects Unbound UX (`Box 1..24` + `Preset`), hides `Box 25` from frontend navigation, and labels internal box `26` as `Preset` in UI.
- Standardized visible stat abbreviations across party cards and editor sliders to `HP/ATK/DEF/SPA/SPD/SPE`, and enforced the standard display order to avoid `SPD` ambiguity between Special Defense and Speed.
- Saving edits in PC now preserves the currently selected box instead of resetting to Box 1.
- Money modal input now enforces whole-number entry and a six-digit cap (`999999`) in UI.
- Money modal now includes a hover note clarifying that backend safety clamps values to the legal in-game range.
- Added a global `Legit` header toggle (default OFF) that keeps per-stat EV cap (`0..252`) always enforced and applies total EV cap (`510`) only when enabled.
- EV editing now shows explicit legal-spread feedback (`Total EV` and `Remaining`) while Legit mode is ON.
- Level editing now surfaces explicit `1..100` cap guidance and normalizes out-of-range values in editor flows, with backend party level updates returning clamp metadata (`requested_level`, `was_clamped`).
- Editor tabs were reorganized for faster stat workflows: `Stats` now groups Level, Nature, IVs, EVs, and Ability controls in one place.
- Hidden ability labels now prioritize readability by showing ability name first (for example `Sheer Force (HA)`).
- Added Showdown/Smogon set import via `FROM SMOGON` in both Add Pokemon and existing Pokemon editor flows, with strict catalog validation (species/item/ability/moves), clear blocking errors, and deterministic duplicate-item fallback (lowest ID + warning).
- Smogon species resolution now supports regional suffix input (`-Alola`, `-Galar`, `-Hisui`) and defaults multi-form base species imports to the canonical base form (lowest-ID deterministic fallback with warning).
- New PC Pokemon insertions now default IVs to `31/31/31/31/31/31` and infer full owner template from existing save data (OT name + IDNo/TID-linked OTID + owner bytes) instead of zeroed owner fields.

#### RTC Recovery and Metadata Editing

- Added backend RTC pair-repair API endpoint `POST /rtc/repair-candidates` to generate a repair zip pack (manifest + ordered fallback candidates) from tampered and NPC-fixed save files.
- Added backend RTC quick-fix API endpoint `POST /rtc/quick-fix` to generate single-file fallback candidates using tracked manifest data (`backend/data/rtc_manifest_unbound_v1.json`).
- Added frontend metadata editing card for RTC workflows on the load screen, including tabbed actions (`Pair Repair` and `Quick Fix`).
- Added API client download helpers for RTC pair and quick-fix packs in `frontend/src/services/apiClient.js`, then extended them to full backend/local runtime parity.
- Added full local-mode RTC parity for GitHub Pages usage: manifest generation, pair candidate generation, quick-fix candidate generation, and zip pack downloads now run fully in frontend JS.
- Added RTC parity regression script (`frontend/scripts/rtc-parity-regression.mjs`) and npm commands to run RTC + existing parity checks.
- Fixed RTC quick-fix candidate generation to copy source footer bytes correctly during coherent layout rebuild (instead of destination footer bytes).
- Fixed RTC quick-fix opaque checksum handling to apply fixed-reference checksum metadata for patched opaque sections (`id 0`, `4`, `13`).
- Refreshed quick-fix manifest payload (`backend/data/rtc_manifest_unbound_v1.json`, mirrored to frontend public data) from the known tampered `Unbound_2_before_promote_working.sav` to `Unbound_2_fixed.sav` pair.
- Fixed pair-repair backend wiring to build manifests through `backend/tools/rtc_patch.py` (`build_manifest`) before candidate generation.

#### Responsive UI and Internationalization

- Reworked the frontend shell for responsive behavior across desktop/tablet/mobile while preserving single-page dynamic sections.
- App title in UI now uses `PUSE` and the pre-upload screen now includes concise onboarding content plus visible upload and drag-and-drop actions.
- Branding now references Pokemon Unbound in both the browser tab title and onboarding copy, while keeping a compact `PUSE` header label on small screens.
- Added onboarding note clarifying compatibility with `.sav` files from CFRU + DPE ROM hacks.
- Upload flow now accepts `.srm` files in addition to `.sav`, preserves the original extension on download, and updates the download button label accordingly.
- Added explicit `RESTART / LOAD NEW FILE` control in the loaded-state header.
- Standardized modal dismissal UX: money modal, Pokemon editor modal, and bag edit modal now close via `X`, outside click, and `Esc`.
- PC Box view now renders explicit empty slots and keeps a responsive grid (up to 6 columns where space allows) without forced horizontal scrolling on small devices.
- Party card icon sizing was adjusted to avoid sprite cropping in slot frames.
- Nature labels were normalized to English-only for public international UX parity in both backend and local mode flows (`Hardy`, `Adamant`, etc.); fallback text is now `Unknown`.
- Refreshed the pre-upload home page into a full onboarding layout with clearer product messaging, capability cards, a step-based flow, and responsive static workflow previews for Party/PC/Editor/Bag interactions.
- Kept the save upload interaction as the primary call to action near the top of the home page while improving first-time-user clarity before file upload.
- Moved RTC metadata recovery UX into a collapsed advanced section placed directly below the upload container to reduce cognitive load for new users while preserving tool accessibility.
- Added a footer with repository links and corrected changelog link targeting for the `master` branch.

#### Documentation

- README was streamlined to be more technical and less screenshot-driven, replacing image walkthroughs with website-first onboarding guidance and explicit redirect to the live app UX.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Frontend runtime mode abstraction with `backend` and `local` modes.
- In-browser local save editing engine (`frontend/src/core/*`) for party, PC, bag, money, checksums, and save export.
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) with SPA fallback support.
- Maintainer/developer docs: save editing guide and frontend local migration spec.
- Party level editing with growth-curve support (auto detection + manual override).
- PC level editing in the Pokemon editor modal (manual growth-curve selection).
- Shared frontend growth utilities for deterministic level-to-EXP conversion.
- Key Items pocket quick-detection and editing support (backend + local mode).
- Initial pocket mapping data file for item-family classification (`key`, `tm`, `hm`, `ball`, `berry`, `main`).
- ROM item probe utility for early reverse-engineering checks against `.gba` files.
- ROM item table extractor for Unbound (`44`-byte item structs, pocket-code metadata export).

### Changed

- App now routes UI operations through a unified API client (`frontend/src/services/apiClient.js`) instead of direct `fetch` calls in components.
- Bag quick pocket detection improved with richer confidence metadata and clearer fallback guidance in UI.
- Item icon resolution now prioritizes `backend/icons/items/Base Items/` before other item icon folders.
- TM item naming data updated to include type suffixes (for example `TM01: Focus Punch - Fighting`).
- README updated for frontend-first runtime model, simplified local run instructions, and compact maintainer deployment notes.
- Pokemon editor tab renamed from `Nature & Item` to `LV, Nature & Item`.
- Backend party payload now includes `exp` to support level workflows.
- Bag editor now forces quantity to `1` for TM/HM and Key Items to keep pocket writes consistent.
- Added reverse-engineering notes documenting discovered ROM item-table anchors and pocket byte mapping.
- Bag pocket family classification now uses ROM-derived item pocket metadata (backend and local mode), with fallback constants if metadata is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Held item icon visibility in Pokemon editor modal (header + current item panel), with robust fallback for missing/broken icons.
- TM/HM icon matching logic:
  - HM resolves by numeric icon naming (`hm01`, `hm02`, ...).
  - TM prefers type-based icons (`tm-fighting`, `tm-water`, ...), then falls back to numeric variants if available.

### Removed

- Legacy `backend/icons.py` test utility script.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Public repo baseline: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, env examples, backend requirements.
- Fast bag workflows: quick pocket bootstrap (main/ball/berry/tm) while keeping item search as canonical fallback.
- Reliable pocket support for Ball pouch, Berry pouch, and TM case (including add/edit flows).
- Frontend money editing modal connected to backend money patch endpoint.
- Static data loading from `backend/data/items.txt`, `backend/data/pokemon.txt`, `backend/data/moves.txt`, and `backend/data/tms.txt`.
- Optional item icon lookup endpoint with fuzzy matching and graceful no-icon behavior.

### Changed

- Backend refactor to module-based structure under `backend/modules/`.
- API startup now uses static lookup files instead of CT/Lua parsing at runtime.
- Bag editing robustness improved (encoding handling, TM/HM quantity safeguards, candidate quality metadata).
- Optional sprite behavior hardened: app runs even when pokemon/item icon assets are missing.

### Removed

- Legacy runtime dependency on `backend/data/extractor.py`.
- Legacy reverse-engineering scripts and Qt GUI from active v1 scope.
